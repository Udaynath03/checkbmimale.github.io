          <p>BMI (body mass index) is a tool to help you find out if you’re a healthy weight for your height. It’s
            useful to know because when your weight is not within a healthy range, your health may be at risk. </p>

          <br>

          <p>BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared. For example, a
            weight of 73kg and height of 1.70m = 73kg/2.89m = 25.26kg/m<sup>2</sup> or a BMI of 25.</p>
